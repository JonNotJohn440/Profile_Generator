# Profile_Generator

AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

This application fulfills that need. The application is invoked by using the following command: 

```bash
node index.js
```

It is built with Inquirer and runs on Jest.
